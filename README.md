This is an assignment from Kvix as part of a jobapplication.

How to run:

1. Clone the repository and navigate into it.
2. Open up a terminal and write "npm update" (this will get all the dependencies)
3. Then run both the server and application with "npm run dev"


*Commands*

*npm run server* - Runs only the server

*npm run appclient* - Runs only the client

*npm run dev* - Runs both the client and server
